In day-to-day life, people use cars for commuting to work, shopping, visiting family and friends, etc. Research shows that more than 76% of people prevent themselves from traveling somewhere if they don't have a car. Most people tend to buy different types of cars based on their day-to-day necessities and preferences. So, it is essential for automobile companies to analyze the preference of their customers before launching a car model into the market. Austo, a UK-based automobile company aspires to grow its business into the US market after successfully establishing its footprints in the European market.\n","\n","In order to be familiar with the types of cars preferred by the customers and factors influencing the car purchase behavior in the US market, Austo has contracted a consulting firm. Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has created a dataset of 3 major types of cars that are extensively used across the US market. They have collected various details of the car owners which can be analyzed to understand the automobile market of the US.\n","\n","### Objective\n","\n","Austo's management team wants to understand the demand of the buyers and trends in the US market. They want to build customer profiles based on the analysis to identify new purchase opportunities so that they can manipulate the business strategy and production to meet certain demand levels. Further, the analysis will be a good way for management to understand the dynamics of a new market. Suppose you are a Data Scientist working at the consulting firm that has been contracted by Austo. You are given the task to create buyer's profiles for different types of cars with the available data as well as a set of recommendations for Austo. Perform the data analysis to generate useful insights that will help the automobile company to grow its business.\n","\n","### Data Description\n","\n","austo_automobile.csv: The dataset contains buyer's data corresponding to different types of products(cars).\n","\n","### Data Dictionary\n","\n","* Age: Age of the customer\n","* Gender: Gender of the customer\n","* Profession: Indicates whether the customer is a salaried or business person\n","* Marital_status: Marital status of the customer\n","* Education: Refers to the highest level of education completed by the customer\n","* No_of_dependents: Number of dependents(partner/children/spouse) of the customer\n","* Personal_loan: Indicates whether the customer availed a personal loan or not\n","* House_loan: Indicates whether the customer availed house loan or not\n","* Partner_working: Indicates whether the customer's partner is working or not\n","* Salary: Annual Salary of the customer\n","* Partner_salary: Annual Salary of the customer's partner\n","* Total_salary: Annual household income (Salary + Partner_salary) of the customer's family\n","* Price: Price of the car\n","* Make: Car type (Hatchback/Sedan/SUV)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a510201c","metadata":{"id":"a510201c"},"source":["## Importing necessary libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Installing the libraries with the specified version.\n","!pip install numpy==1.25.2 pandas==1.5.3 matplotlib==3.7.1 seaborn==0.13.1 -q --user"],"metadata":{"id":"AL3Z4aST_C9M"},"id":"AL3Z4aST_C9M","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Note**: *After running the above cell, kindly restart the notebook kernel and run all cells sequentially from the start again.*"],"metadata":{"id":"b3Ei-pgB-aC5"},"id":"b3Ei-pgB-aC5"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"31fc37d1","metadata":{"id":"31fc37d1"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import libraries for data manipulation\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# import libraries for data visualization\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cc20fea3","metadata":{"id":"cc20fea3"},"source":["## Importing the dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# uncomment and run the following lines for Google Colab\n","# from google.colab import drive\n","# drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"bdan3MfdaM-O"},"id":"bdan3MfdaM-O","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f57ee46a","metadata":{"id":"f57ee46a","scrolled":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# read the data\n","df = pd.read_csv('austo_automobile.csv')\n","# returns the first 5 rows\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cecaade4","metadata":{"id":"cecaade4"},"source":["## Data Overview"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9790238c","metadata":{"id":"9790238c"},"source":["#### Question 1: How many rows and columns are present in the data?
